Crate nginx server azure
=========================
# General information
This service has stack of bash+ansible+az cli
This service had these steps:
1. create an VM on azure cloud(the os is centos)
2. create network and firewall rules
3. create load balancer
4. configure server (install deps)
5. install web server




# Before you started
configure this cloud shell by using this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart
In case your cloud is not configured to use ansible do these steps:
Open cloud cli (!use bash)
* enter this comand to show account list:
```
az account list
```
* export parameter:
```
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your-subscription-id>
```

<your-subscription_id> - change this (the information in previous step

* generate the ssh key to access the vm's

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

# This Download the source code and structure description

To get this service download  it in your cloud shell home directory  by using: 

```
git clone https://github.com/f4th3r/devops-interview-task
```

Strucure:

create_ss_cert.yml  create_vm_azure.yml  firstconnect.yml  host  lb  nginx  scripts   tmp

ROOT dir contains:
* create_ss_cert.yml  - ansible playbook to create certs
* create_vm_azure.yml - ansible playbook to create vm 
* firstconnect.yml    - ansible playbook to first connect to vm 
* host - host file for vm connection from cloud shell 


Dir lb contains:

createlb.yml - DEPRICATED
* createlb.yml ansible playbook to create lb  

 
 
Dir nginx  contains:
install_set_nginx.yaml  nginx.conf              ssl.conf                static.conf             test.txt

* install_set_nginx.yaml  - ansible playbook to create nginx
* nginx.conf              - nginx config
* ssl.conf                - ssl config
* static.conf             - 80 port config
* test.txt                - the main page with version

Dir scripts contains:

create_start_service.sh  daemon_health_check_443.sh  health_check_443.sh  log.log

* create_start_service.sh  - the main scripts
* daemon_health_check_443.sh  - start daemon to healthcheck script
* health_check_443.sh  - healphcheck script
* log.log  - file logs to log healph checks failds

Dir tmp  - for temp files





# HOWTO configure
If you want to change parameters such as:

* ResourceGroup            - Resource group in az
* myVnet                   - Virtal network in az 
* mySubnet                 - Subnet that will be created in az
* myPublicIP               - The name of intrface with external ip
* myNetworkSecurityGroup   - The security group with firewall rules
* MyNIC                    - The vm network interface
* myVM                     - The name of VM in az with web server       
* MyLb                     - The load balancer name
* PublicIPMyLb             - Public ip for lb 
* port_for_ssh             - the ssh port(front port of LB). The destination port is 22          

Change  main script in config section:  scripts/create_start_service.sh



# HOWTO start
To start creating and configure service just run:
1. go to scripts catalog:

```
cd scripts
```
2. start script:

```
./create_start_service.sh
```
PS:
The are to ways to start this script. 
1. The more secure way is just starting like in step 2.
2. The second one is

```
./create_start_service.sh username password
```
* username - vm admin user
* password - vm admin password 


After starting script it will ask for username and password. 
You will see the process of installation.
It will stop on the first connect step.

* The authenticity of host '[ip]:port ([ip]:port)' can't be established.

Just say yes and push <ENTER>.

If you want to use it without promt set StrictHostKeyChecking no in your /etc/ssh/ssh_config.
!!!!It will work only in ansible vm host. And Wont work in cloud shell because of permissions.

The process will take drom 3-5 minutes.
After finishing you will see the credentials and ip adress to use ssh and https.




# Testing

The are 2 scripts to start simple check.

just go to 

```
cd scripts
```
change the ip adrees in check create_start_service.sh sript(use your new ip of balancer in previous step) 

To start check 

```
./health_check_443.sh
```
It will check version and web server health


If you want to start in background mode

```
./daemon_health_check_443.sh &&
```
This mode start check it every 5 second and if the service down or version is changed(not that axpected) 
it will echo this and write the log.

To kill process just use
```
ps aux | grep daemon

````
and kill the process by id

```
kill process_name
```


# Delete service
To delete service just use command:

az group delete --name  myResourceGroup

myResourceGroup - id group with that service
!!!!DONT USE this command in case you have  another service in this namespace. 
This command delete all services in this group
